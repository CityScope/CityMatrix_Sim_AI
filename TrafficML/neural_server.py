    Purpose: Create UDP server that can wait for new cities from Grasshopper, predict traffic and wait output given structure and population, and send that result back to Grasshopper. This server uses the CNN stored in the saved_model.json and saved_model.h5 local files. This can be configured with the ROOT_FILENAME parameter.
    TODO:
    - Still need to have some sort of update() function that fits the model on some new set of data points
