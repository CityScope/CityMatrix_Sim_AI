# CityMatrixServer

This is the main UDP server that we have built to handle all of our city-related operations. We focus on two main server functions here: ML and AI.

- **ML**: Run traffic and solar radiation linear regression analysis on a city to predict new values for the user.
- **AI**: Given the current city state, *suggest* a new city that optimizes some weighted combination of metrics for the city.

### Setup

Before you begin the server for the first time, there are several steps you will want to complete.
